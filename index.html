      A red apple is a round, typically small to medium-sized fruit with smooth,
      glossy skin that ranges in color from bright, vibrant red to a deeper,
      almost burgundy hue. The skin of the apple is firm and can sometimes have
      faint yellow or green streaks, depending on the variety. When you cut into
      it, the flesh is crisp, juicy, and white or slightly creamy in color. The
      taste of a red apple can vary from sweet to slightly tart, offering a
      satisfying crunch with each bite. The core of the apple contains small,
      dark brown seeds. Red apples are often associated with a fresh, wholesome,
      and slightly sweet fragrance.
